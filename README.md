# Spotify Dataset Project

## Overview
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and sample data for analyzing the 900K Spotify Dataset.

## Data
Full dataset files are large and must be downloaded separately from Kaggle:

[900k Spotify Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/devdope/900k-spotify)

Place the downloaded files inside the `data/` folder as follows:

- spotify_dataset.csv
- 900k Definitive Spotify Dataset.json
- final_milliondataset_BERT_500K_revised.json

Sample data files (`*_sample.csv` and `*_sample.json`) are included here for easy testing.
